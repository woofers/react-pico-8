Simply add the game widget to the React application using JSX.

Be sure to include the ~.js~ ~src~ of the game cartridge generated from [[https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php][PICO-8]]'s web export.

If no buttons are nested in the component then the default [[https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php][PICO-8]] buttons will be used.

** Props
*** Src
Source of the game cartridge.  *Required*

This can be obtained from [[https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php][PICO-8]] by loading a game cart, then typing the command ~export index.html~.

[[https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php][PICO-8]] produces two files: the cartridge ~index.js~ and the player ~index.html~.

Since ~react-pico-8~ already has the game player embeded, only the ~.js~ file needs to be provided as the ~src~.
*** Auto Play
~autoPlay~ indicates if the game canvas should attempt to auto-play on page-load. *Default:* ~true~
*** Legacy Buttons
~legacyButtons~ is used to select the type of buttons. *Default:* ~false~
*** Hide Cursor
~hideCusor~ indicates if the cursor is hidden over the game canvas when the game is playing.  *Default:* ~false~
*** Center
~center~ indicates if the game is centred outside of fullscreen mode. *Default:* ~true~
*** Block Keys
If ~blockKeys~ is set keys which are used to interact with the game are blocked from scrolling when the game is running.

If un-set keys will only be blocked when the canvas is focused.  *Default:* ~false~
*** Use Pointer

If ~usePointer~ is set the pointer hand will be used on buttons.

If un-set a normal cursor will be used on all buttons which do not lead to a new page. *Default:* ~true~

*** Unpause On Reset

If ~unpauseOnReset~ is set hitting the reset button when paused will instantly reset the game.

If un-set the game will need to be resumed before it resets. *Default:* ~true~

*** Placeholder
The image to be used as a placeholder prior to starting the game.  If un-set, a black background will be used.  *Default:* ~''~
